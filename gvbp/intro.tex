In this chapter, we study the \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} BP problem,
also known as the generalized multidimensional bin packing problem.
This problem generalizes both $d_g$-dimensional geometric bin packing
and $d_v$-dimensional vector bin packing.
Here $d_g$ and $d_v$ are constants.
See \cref{sec:intro:gvbp} for a detailed introduction to this problem and its significance.

\subsection*{Overview of the Chapter}

In \cref{sec:gvbp-prelims}, we describe some preliminaries related
to \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} BP.

In \cref{sec:simple-algos}, we give two simple algorithms for \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP,
called $\simplePack$ and $\betterSimplePack$, having AARs of
$6(d+1)$ and $3(1+\ln(d+1))+\eps$, respectively, for any $\eps > 0$.
For $d = 1$, $\betterSimplePack$'s AAR improves to $\approx 4.21640 + \eps$.
We also extend these algorithms to \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} BP.

In \cref{sec:rna}, we describe our version of the Round-and-Approx (R\&A) framework
and show how it can be applied to $\simplePack$.
We defer some formal proofs related to R\&A to \cref{sec:rna-extra}.

In \cref{chap:gv-rbbp}, we describe a more sophisticated algorithm for \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP,
called $\cbPack$, that improves upon the algorithms of this chapter.
