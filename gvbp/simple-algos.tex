\section{Simple Algorithms}
\label{sec:simple-algos}

In this section, we look at simple algorithms for \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP
and \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} BP.
We will not rotate the items while packing them.
Nevertheless, we will show that our approximation guarantees
hold for both the rotational and non-rotational versions.

\subsection{Steinberg's Algorithm}

A key ingredient in our algorithms for \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP is
Steinberg's algorithm~\cite{steinberg1997strip} for rectangle packing.

\begin{lemma}[Steinberg's algorithm~\cite{steinberg1997strip}]
\label{thm:steinberg}
Let $I$ be a set of rectangles. Let $w_{\max} \defeq \max_{i \in I} w(i)$
and $h_{\max} \defeq \max_{i \in I} h(i)$. Consider a bin of width $W$ and height $H$,
where $w_{\max} \le W$ and $h_{\max} \le H$.
Then there is a $O(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$-time algorithm to pack $I$ into the bin if
\[ 2a(I) \le WH - \max(2w_{\max} - W, 0) \cdot \max(2h_{\max} - H, 0) \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label{corr:steinberg}
Let $I$ be a set of rectangles, where $a(I) \le 1$.
Then there is a $O(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$-time algorithm to pack $I$ into
3 square bins of side length 1.
\end{lemma}

{Packing items of area at most 1 into three square bins:
First use Steinberg's algorithm to pack the items into a bin of width 2 and height 1.
Then make a vertical cut in the middle of the bin
and use that to split the items into three bins.}
\label{fig:steinberg}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
Pack $I$ into a bin of width 2 and height 1 using Steinberg's algorithm
(see \cref{thm:steinberg}).
Then cut the bin vertically into 2 unit-sized squares.
The items which lie completely inside the left half can be packed into a unit-sized bin.
The items which lie completely inside the right half can be packed into a unit-sized bin.
The items which lie on the cutting line are stacked one-over-the-other,
so we can pack them into a unit-sized bin.
See \cref{fig:steinberg} for an example.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Algorithms \texorpdfstring{$\simplePack$}{simple-pack}
and \texorpdfstring{$\betterSimplePack$}{better-simple-pack}}
\label{sec:span-pack}

Let $I$ be a \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP instance.
Let $\Ihat \defeq \{\Span(i): i \in I\}$, i.e., $\Ihat$ is a classical bin packing instance.
The algorithm $\simplePack(I)$ first runs the Next-Fit algorithm on $\Ihat$.
Let $[\Jhat_1,$ $\Jhat_2,$ $\ldots,$ $\Jhat_m]$
be the resulting bin packing of $\Ihat$ into $m$ bins.
For each $\Jhat_j \subseteq \Ihat$, let $J_j$ be the corresponding items from $I$.
Then $\forall k \in [d_v],$ $v_k(J_j) \le 1$ and $\vol(J_j) \le 1$.
$\simplePack$ then uses Steinberg's algorithm to pack each $J_j$ into at most 3 bins,
giving a packing of $I$ into at most $3m$ bins.

By the property of Next-Fit (see \cref{thm:next-fit} in \cref{sec:preliminaries:simple-algos}),
we get that $m \le \ceil{2\Span(I)}$.
By \cref{thm:span-lb-opt}, we get $3m \le 6(d+1)\opt(I)$.
This gives us the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:span-pack}
For \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP, $\simplePack(I)$ uses at most $3\ceil{2\Span(I)}$ bins,
so $\simplePack$ is a $6(d+1)$-approximation algorithm.
$\simplePack$ runs in $O(nd + n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$ time,
where $n \defeq |I|$.
\end{theorem}

The algorithm $\betterSimplePack$ first computes $\Itild$,
which is a $(d+1)$D VBP instance obtained by
replacing the geometric dimensions of each item $i \in I$ by a single vector dimension $a(i)$.
It computes a bin packing of $\Itild$ using any algorithm $\Acal$.
It then uses Steinberg's algorithm to obtain a bin packing
of $I$ into at most $3|\Acal(\Itild)|$ bins.

Note that $\opt(\Itild) \le \opt(I)$.
If $\Acal$ has an AAR of $\alpha$, then $|\Acal(\Itild)| \le \alpha\opt(\Itild) + O(1)$.
Therefore, $\betterSimplePack$ has an AAR of $3\alpha$.
The $(d+1)$D VBP algorithm by Bansal, Caprara and Sviridenko~\cite{rna}
(parametrized by a constant $\eps > 0$) gives $\alpha = 1+\ln(d+1)+\eps$
and the algorithm by Bansal, Elias and Khan~\cite{bansal2016improved} gives
$\alpha = 1.5+\ln((d+2)/2)+\eps$ (improves to $\alpha = 1+\ln(1.5)+\eps$ for $d=1$).

Although $\simplePack$ has a worse AAR than $\betterSimplePack$,
the number of bins used by $\simplePack$ is upper-bounded in terms of $\Span$,
which is a useful property. Because of this,
we will use it as a subroutine in other algorithms (like $\cbPack$).

Since $|\simplePack(I)|$ is upper-bounded in terms of $\Span(I)$,
and $|\betterSimplePack(I)|$ is upper-bounded in terms of $\opt(\Itild)$,
their approximation guarantees hold for both the
rotational and non-rotational versions of \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP.

\subsection{Extending to Higher Geometric Dimensions}

The algorithms for \geomvec{2}{$d$} BP can be extended to \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} BP.
We just need an algorithm for the following problem:
\textsl{given a set $J$ of $d_g$-dimensional cuboids where $\vol(J) \le 1$,
pack $J$ into a small number of bins.}

We used Steinberg's algorithm when $d_g = 2$.
When $d_g = 3$, we can use the algorithm of \cite[Section 2]{diedrich2008approximation}
to pack $J$ into at most 9 bins.
For $d_g > 3$, we can use the $\fhk[4]$ algorithm, which is a variant of
Caprara's $\hdhk$ algorithm~\cite{caprara2008},
to pack $J$ into at most $4^{d_g} + 2^{d_g} - 1$ bins.
We fully describe and analyze $\fhk$ in \cref{sec:fhk},
but we give a smaller, self-contained analysis in \cref{sec:fh4}.

Therefore, $\simplePack$ will use
$b\ceil{2\Span(I)}$ bins, where $b \defeq 3$ when $d_g=2$,
$b \defeq 9$ when $d_g=3$, and $b \defeq 4^{d_g}+2^{d_g}-1$ when $d_g > 3$.
Hence, $\simplePack$ is $2b(d_v+1)$-approximate.
Similarly, the AAR of $\betterSimplePack$ is $b(1 + \ln(d_v + 1) + \eps)$.

\subsection{Simple Algorithm for the Knapsack Problem}
\label{sec:simple-gvks}

Using similar ideas, we can get an algorithm for the \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} KS problem.
Let $I$ be a set of \geomvecdim{$d_g$}{$d_v$} items. Let $p(i)$ be the profit of item $i$.
We want to pack a maximum-profit subset of $I$ into a bin.

Let $\Itild$ be a set of $(d_v+1)$D vectors obtained by replacing the
geometric dimensions of each item $i$ by a single vector dimension $\vol(i)$.
Let $\Acal$ be a $(d_v+1)$D vector knapsack (VKS) algorithm
having approximation ratio $\alpha \ge 1$.
$\Acal$ gives us a packing of items $\Jhat \subseteq \Itild$ into a bin.
Let $J$ be the corresponding items in $I$.
Then $\vol(J) \le 1$ and $\forall k \in [d_v], v_k(J) \le 1$.
We can pack $J$ into at most $b$ bins, where $b=3$ for $d_g=2$ (by Steinberg's algorithm),
$b=9$ for $d_g=3$ (by \cite{diedrich2008approximation}),
and $b = 4^{d_g} + 2^{d_g} - 1$ for $d_g > 3$ (by the $\fhk[4]$ algorithm).

Let $J_1, J_2, \ldots, J_b$ be the bins that $J$ is packed into.
\WLoG, assume $p(J_1) \ge p(J_2) \ge \ldots \ge p(J_b)$. Then output the packing $J_1$
as the answer to the \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} KS problem.
Since any feasible solution to the \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} KS instance $I$ also gives a
feasible solution to the VKS instance $\Itild$, we get
$\opt_{\mathrm{KS}}(\Itild) \ge \opt_{\mathrm{KS}}(I)$.
Since $\Acal$ is $\alpha$-approximate, we get $p(J) \ge \opt(\Itild)/\alpha$. Hence,
\[ p(J_1) \ge \frac{p(J)}{b}
\ge \frac{\opt(\Itild)}{b\alpha}
\ge \frac{\opt(I)}{b\alpha} \]
Therefore, we get a $b\alpha$-approximation algorithm for \geomvec{$d_g$}{$d_v$} KS.
Using the PTAS for $(d_v+1)$D VKS by Frieze and Clarke~\cite{frieze1984approximation},
we get $\alpha = 1+\eps$.
