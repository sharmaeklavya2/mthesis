\section{Classical Bin Packing Problem}

In the classical bin packing problem, we are given a set $I$ of items.
Each item $i \in I$ has a size $s(i) \in (0, 1]$ associated with it.
Our goal is to partition $I$ into the minimum number of bins,
such that the sum of sizes of items in each bin is at most 1.
The classical bin packing problem and its generalizations
have diverse applications in computer science and operations research,
like packing trucks with a given weight limit,
allocating jobs to servers,
allocating memory in computers \cite{handbook-of-combinopt-bp},
or assigning commercials to station breaks in television programming,

Classical bin packing is known to be NP-hard.
In fact, deciding whether a set of items can be packed into two bins is NP-complete,
by a simple reduction from the partition problem.
Hence, we look at approximation algorithms.
Let $\opt(I)$ be the minimum number of bins required to pack a set $I$ of items.
An algorithm $\Acal$ is said to be $\alpha$-approximate iff
$\Acal$ requires at most $\alpha\opt(I)$ bins to pack $I$.

Since it is NP-complete to decide whether a set of items can be packed into two bins,
it is NP-hard to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for bin-packing
with approximation ratio less than $3/2$.
(Using the results of D\'osa and Sgall, we can prove that the First-Fit Decreasing algorithm
is $3/2$-approximate \cite{dosa2013first,dosa2007tight}.)
However, such a reasoning doesn't rule out the existence of an algorithm
that uses $\opt(I) + 1$ bins.
Therefore, we turn our attention to \emph{asymptotic approximation algorithms}.
\begin{definition}
An algorithm $\Acal$ is said to be $\alpha$-asymptotic-approximate iff
$\Acal$ requires at most $\alpha\opt(I) + \beta$ bins
for some value $\beta \in o(\opt(I))$ (usually, $\beta$ is a constant).
$\alpha$ is called the asymptotic approximation ratio (AAR) of $\Acal$.
\end{definition}

An Asymptotic Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (APTAS) is an algorithm
that accepts a parameter $\eps > 0$ and gives an AAR of $1+\eps$.
The running time for such an algorithm usually increases as $\eps$ decreases.
